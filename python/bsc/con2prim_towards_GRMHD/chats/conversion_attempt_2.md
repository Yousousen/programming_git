**Human:**

 I have implemented a neural network to learn conservative-to-primitive 
conversion in relativistic hydrodynamics. My input data are the three 
conservative variables, namely the rest mass density $\rho$, the velocity in the 
x-direction $v_x$ and the specific internal energy $\epsilon$. The output of the 
neural network is the primitive variable pressure $p$.

I would like now to extend the input so that it also includes the velocity in
the y-direction $v_y$ and the velocity in the z-direction `v_z`. Please make the
necessary changes to the code that I will send you. These changes include

1. Create a sampling interval for `v_y` and `v_z`. These sampling intervals 
   should be the same as that for `v_z`.
2. The equation to calculate `W` should no longer use just $v_x^2$ but it should
   use  $v^2 = v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2$ instead.
3. Make the necessary changes to the input and the return values of the
   functions.
4. Of course make the necessary changes to the docstrings as well.
5. You can restructure the code as you see fit for the inclusion of the velocity
   in the y- and z-directions. For instance, you can use a vector for velocity
   instead of scalars if you think this is better, and you could add additional
   functions to avoid repetition where needed.

Here is my code for the generation of data, I will send you other code that 
needs to be changed in subsequent messages
