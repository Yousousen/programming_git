Here's the code with improved readability, using comments and variable names that are more descriptive:

python

```python
def train_neural_network(model, optimizer, loss_function, batch_size, num_epochs, 
                         X_train, Y_train, X_test=None, Y_test=None):
    """
    Train a neural network with given hyperparameters and data.
    """
    # Create a DataLoader for the training data
    train_data_loader = DataLoader(
        dataset=torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(X_train, Y_train),
        batch_size=batch_size,
        shuffle=True
    )
    
    # Initialize lists to store training and test losses
    training_losses = []
    test_losses = [] if X_test is not None and Y_test is not None else None

    # Train the model for the specified number of epochs
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        epoch_loss = 0.0

        # Iterate over batches of training data
        for inputs, targets in train_data_loader:
            # Reset parameter gradients
            optimizer.zero_grad()

            # Perform forward pass and calculate loss
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = loss_function(outputs, targets)

            # Perform backward pass and optimize parameters
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

            # Update the epoch loss
            epoch_loss += loss.item()

        # Calculate and store the average training loss for the current epoch
        average_training_loss = epoch_loss / len(train_data_loader)
        training_losses.append(average_training_loss)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Training Loss: {average_training_loss:.4f}")

        # Calculate and store the test loss for the current epoch, if applicable
        if test_losses is not None:
            test_outputs = model(X_test)
            test_loss = loss_function(test_outputs, Y_test).item()
            test_losses.append(test_loss)
            print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}")

    # Return the training and test losses, if applicable
    return (training_losses, test_losses) if test_losses is not None else training_losses
```

This version of the code includes more descriptive variable names, comments, and a docstring for the function. It also eliminates the need for checking `X_test` and `Y_test` twice, by using the `test_losses` variable instead.

The issue in both functions is that the `plt.savefig()` function is called after `plt.show()`. This results in an empty plot being saved to the file. To fix this, you should call `plt.savefig()` before `plt.show()`. Here are the corrected functions:

python

```python
def plot_predictions(model, X, Y_true):
    # Create a figure and an axis
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))
    # Compute the predictions from the inputs
    Y_pred = model(X).detach().numpy()
    # Plot the predictions and the true values as scatter plots
    ax.scatter(Y_true, Y_pred, label="Predictions", s=2, alpha=0.3)
    ax.scatter(Y_true, Y_true, label="True Values", s=2, alpha=0.3)
    # Set the title, labels, and legend
    ax.set_title("Predictions versus True Values")
    ax.set_xlabel("True Value")
    ax.set_ylabel("Predicted Value")
    ax.legend()
    # Save and show the plot
    plt.savefig("predictions.png")
    plt.show()

def plot_losses(train_losses, test_losses=None):
    # Create a figure and an axis
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))
    # Plot the train losses
    ax.plot(train_losses, label="Train Loss")
    # If test losses are given, plot them as well
    if test_losses is not None:
        ax.plot(test_losses, label="Test Loss")
    # Set the title, labels, and legend
    ax.set_title("Losses during Training")
    ax.set_xlabel("Epoch")
    ax.set_ylabel("Loss")
    ax.legend()
    # Save and show the plot
    plt.savefig("losses.png")
    plt.show()
```

By calling `plt.savefig()` before `plt.show()`, the correct plots will be saved to the files "predictions.png" and "losses.png".

To save the plots of all functions, you need to modify the file names in the `plot_losses` and `plot_predictions` functions by including the function name. Here's the modified code:

python

```python
# Loop over each function to be approximated
for i in range(len(functions)):
    # Print the function name
    print(f"Approximating function {function_names[i]}")
    # Create a neural network with given hyperparameters
    input_size = 3 # The number of input variables (x1, x2, x3)
    hidden_size = 32 # The number of units in the hidden layer
    output_size = 1 # The number of output variables (y)
    activation = nn.ReLU # The activation function for the hidden layer
    # Create a network with 3 hidden layers and ReLU activations
    hidden_sizes = [32, 64, 128]
    activations = [nn.ReLU, nn.ReLU, nn.ReLU]
    model = create_network(input_size, output_size,
                        hidden_sizes, activations)
    # Create an instance of VariableNetwork by passing the model
    network = VariableNetwork(model)

    # Create an optimizer with given hyperparameters
    optimizer = optim.Adam(network.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    # Create a loss function with given hyperparameters
    loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
    # Train the network with given hyperparameters and data
    batch_size = 64 # The number of samples in each batch
    epochs = 50 # The number of times to loop over the whole dataset
    train_losses, test_losses = train_network(network, optimizer, loss_fn,
                                            batch_size, epochs,
                                            X_train.dataset, outputs_train[i].dataset,
                                            X_test.dataset, outputs_test[i].dataset)
    # Plot the losses during training
    plot_losses(train_losses, test_losses, function_names[i])
    # Plot the predictions versus the true values
    plot_predictions(network, X, outputs[i], function_names[i])
    # Save the network
    torch.save(network, f"network{function_names[i]}.pt")
```

Now, update the `plot_losses` and `plot_predictions` functions to accept the `function_name` argument and use it in the `plt.savefig()` function:

python

```python
def plot_predictions(model, X, Y_true, function_name):
    # (The rest of the function remains the same)
    # Save and show the plot
    plt.savefig(f"predictions_{function_name}.png")
    plt.show()

def plot_losses(train_losses, test_losses=None, function_name=None):
    # (The rest of the function remains the same)
    # Save and show the plot
    plt.savefig(f"losses_{function_name}.png")
    plt.show()
```

Now, the code will save the plots for all functions with the respective function name included in the file name.
