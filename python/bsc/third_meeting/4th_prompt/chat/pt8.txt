The only difference is that for ReduceLROnPlateau, you need to pass the validation loss as the metric value to the step() function, while for other schedulers, you don’t need to pass any argument.

For example, if the learning rate is too high or too low, the network may not learn anything or diverge. If the number of hidden units or layers is too small or too large, the network may underfit or overfit. If the activation function or the loss function is not appropriate for the output type, the network may produce wrong predictions.</p>\n<p>Another possible cause is that the optimization method is not exploring enough of the search space or is stuck in a local optimum. For example, if the optimization method is using a greedy strategy or a fixed step size, it may miss better hyperparameters that are far away from the current ones.

You can reduce the range of the number of hidden layers and units to avoid overfitting. For example, you can set n_layers to be between 1 and 3, and n_units to be between 1 and 64 for each layer.</li>\n<li>Since your output is a continuous value, you should use a linear activation function for the output layer, instead of ReLU, Tanh or Sigmoid. This will ensure that the network can produce any real value as output, instead of being constrained by a non-linear function.</li>\n<li>Since your output is a continuous value, you should use a regression loss function, such as MSE or MAE, instead of CrossEntropy. CrossEntropy is a classification loss function that expects discrete labels as targets, not continuous values. Using CrossEntropy will cause errors in your network training and evaluation.</li>\n<li>Since you are using different types of optimizers and schedulers, you should also optimize their specific hyperparameters, such as momentum for SGD, beta for Adam, step_size for StepLR, etc. This will allow you to fine-tune each optimizer and scheduler according to their characteristics and behavior.</li>\n<li>Since you are using a small subset of the original dataset (8000 samples for training and 2000 samples for testing), you don’t need a very large batch size or a very high number of epochs.

Each scheduler has its own hyperparameters that control how it adjusts the learning rate during the training process. For example, the StepLR scheduler reduces the learning rate by a factor of gamma every step_size epochs, while the ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler reduces the learning rate by a factor of factor when the validation loss stops improving for patience epochs.</p>\n<p>The ranges and distributions of these hyperparameters are not fixed, but rather depend on your problem and data. You can use trial.suggest_* functions to sample different values for these hyperparameters and see which ones work best for your network. However, you should also use some common sense and prior knowledge to set reasonable bounds and distributions for these hyperparameters. For example, you should not set gamma or factor to be greater than 1, as this would increase the learning rate instead of reducing it. You should also not set step_size or patience to be too large or too small, as this would make the learning rate change too infrequently or too frequently.</p>\n<p>To give you some general guidelines on how to choose these hyperparameters, you can refer to some web sources   that explain how different schedulers work and what are their advantages and disadvantages.
