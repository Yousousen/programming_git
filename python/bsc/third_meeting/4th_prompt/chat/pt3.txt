You have also defined a <code>train_and_eval</code> function that takes these objects as arguments and trains and evaluates the model on the given data.

For example, if the trial suggests to use MSE as the loss function, then you are using MSE as the evaluation metric.

The objective function should return the value that you want to minimize during the optimization process. This is usually the validation loss or error, which is different from the test loss or error. The validation loss or error is calculated on a subset of the training data that is not used for updating the model weights. The test loss or error is calculated on a separate dataset that is not used for training or validation. The validation loss or error is used to compare different hyperparameter values and select the best ones. The test loss or error is used to evaluate the final performance of the model on unseen data.

The loss function is used to update the model weights during training, while the evaluation metric is used to measure the performance of the model on the test data.

For example, you could use MSE or MAE as both the loss function and the evaluation metric. You could also use R-squared or coefficient of determination as an evaluation metric, which measures how well your model fits the data. You could also use a plot of predicted values versus true values to visually inspect the quality of your approximation.

Having no activation on the hidden layer or the output layer means that the layer is just a linear transformation of the input. This may reduce the expressive power of the model and limit its ability to approximate nonlinear functions. However, it may also simplify the model and prevent overfitting. It may also depend on the range of the output values. If the output values are not bounded, then having no activation on the output layer may be reasonable. If the output values are bounded, then having an activation on the output layer that matches the range may be better. For example, if the output values are between 0 and 1, then using a sigmoid activation on the output layer may be better.</p>\n<p>You could use Optuna to explore the effect of having no activation on the hidden layer or the output layer by adding a categorical hyperparameter that allows this option. For example, you could add “None” as a possible value for the hidden_activation_name and output_activation_name variables in your create_model function. Then, you could modify your Net class to handle this case by using an identity function as the activation function. You could then compare the results of different trials and see how having no activation affects the performance of your model.</p>\n"},{"bot":false,"text":"Please create code to save best_net, best_loss_fn, best_optimizer, best_batch_size, best_n_epochs, best_scheduler, best_train_losses, best_test_losses, best_train_accuracies, best_test_accuracies for later analysis"},{"bot":true,"text":"<p>One possible way to save these objects for later analysis is to use the pickle module.
