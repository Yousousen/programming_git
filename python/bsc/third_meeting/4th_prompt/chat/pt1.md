# Bing Conversation

**Human:**

 Please generate a code in PyTorch for a neural network to approximate the 
function $h(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_3 x_1^{x_2}$ in the sample space $x_1,x_2,x_3 \in 
[0,10]$ and $10^6$ data samples.

### Finding the best hyperparameters with Optuna

First, Use Optuna to find the best value for the following hyperparameters:

1. Number of hidden layers
2. Number of hidden units
3. Activation functions for the hidden layers
4. Activation function for the output layer
5. Loss function
6. Optimizer
7. Learning rate
8. Batch size
9. Number of epochs
10. Learning rate scheduler

- Make the search space such that hyperparameter tuning can be run in under an 
  hour using four Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8370C CPU @ 2.80GHz cores and no 
  GPU.

### Training the network with the best parameters

- Next, train the network with the best parameters found with Optuna.

### Visualizing results

- Use tensorboard and matplotlib to visualize loss, accuracy, bias, predicted 
  values and true values. Be sure that the visualizations show which 
  hyperparameters are used.

- All output and visualizations should be saved with descriptive names.

***

**Assistant:**

I’m sorry to hear that the code generates an error.😞


The error message suggests that the input and target tensors have different shapes when computing the loss function. This can cause incorrect results due to broadcasting.


To fix this error, you can try to reshape the target tensor to match the input tensor before passing them to the loss function. For example, you can add this line before calling the loss function:

```
y_batch = y_batch.view(-1, 1) # Reshapes the target tensor to have a second dimension of size 1
```


This should make the input and target tensors have the same shape and avoid the error. I hope this helps.😊



***

**Human:**

 Where is the loss function called?

***

**Assistant:**

The loss function is called in the train_and_eval function, inside the loops over the batches in the train and test sets. For example, this line calls the loss function for the train set:

```
loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_batch) # Computes the loss between the predicted values and the target values
```


Similarly, this line calls the loss function for the test set:

```
loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_batch) # Computes the loss between the predicted values and the target values
```


The loss function is passed as an argument to the train_and_eval function, and it is created in the create_model function based on the sampled hyperparameters.😊



***

**Human:**

 I'm sorry, could you add more context as to where I should add the line y_batch = y_batch.view(-1, 1) # Reshapes the target tensor to have a second dimension of size 1
 to fix the error?

***

**Assistant:**

Sure, I can add more context.😊


You should add the line y_batch = y_batch.view(-1, 1) # Reshapes the target tensor to have a second dimension of size 1 before calling the loss function in both the train and test loops. For example, you can modify the code like this:

```
# Looping over the batches in the train set
for x_batch, y_batch in train_loader:
    # Zeroing the gradients
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    # Forward pass
    y_pred = net(x_batch)
    # Reshaping the target tensor to match the input tensor
    y_batch = y_batch.view(-1, 1)
    # Computing the loss
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_batch)
    # Backward pass and optimization
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    # Updating the total loss and correct predictions
    train_loss += loss.item() * x_batch.size(0)
    train_correct += torch.sum((y_pred - y_batch).abs() &lt; 1e-3)

# Looping over the batches in the test set
for x_batch, y_batch in test_loader:
    # Forward pass
    y_pred = net(x_batch)
    # Reshaping the target tensor to match the input tensor
    y_batch = y_batch.view(-1, 1)
    # Computing the loss
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_batch)
    # Updating the total loss and correct predictions
    test_loss += loss.item() * x_batch.size(0)
    test_correct += torch.sum((y_pred - y_batch).abs() &lt; 1e-3)
```


This should fix the error and make the code run without any warnings. I hope this clarifies it.😊



***

**Human:**

 Thank you so much! Now, please explain the code

***

**Assistant:**
You’re welcome.😊


I’ll try to explain the code for you. Here is what it does:



- The code imports the necessary libraries for PyTorch, numpy, Optuna, tensorboard and matplotlib.

- The code defines the function h(x1, x2, x3) = x3 * x1 ** x2 that we want to approximate with a neural network.

- The code generates 10^6 data samples from the function h by randomly sampling x1, x2 and x3 from the interval [0, 10].

- The code converts the data samples to PyTorch tensors and splits them into train and test sets with an 80/20 ratio.

- The code defines a custom neural network class that takes the number of hidden layers, the number of hidden units, the hidden activation function and the output activation function as arguments. The network has a linear layer for each hidden layer and one output layer, and applies the activation functions accordingly. The network also has a forward method that performs a forward pass through the network and returns the output.

- The code defines a function to create a trial network and optimizer based on the sampled hyperparameters from Optuna. The function samples the hyperparameters from a predefined search space, such as the number of hidden layers, the number of hidden units, the activation functions, the loss function, the optimizer, the learning rate, the batch size, the number of epochs and the learning rate scheduler. The function then creates the network, the loss function, the optimizer and the scheduler with the sampled hyperparameters and returns them along with the batch size and the number of epochs.

- The code defines a function to train and evaluate a network on the train and test sets. The function takes the network, the loss function, the optimizer, the batch size, the number of epochs and the scheduler as arguments. The function creates data loaders for the train and test sets with the given batch size. The function then loops over the epochs and performs the following steps:


Sets the network to training mode

Initializes variables to store the total loss and correct predictions for

I’m sorry to hear that you still get the error.😞


The error message suggests that you did not add the line y_batch = y_batch.view(-1, 1) # Reshapes the target tensor to have a second dimension of size 1 before calling the loss function in both the train and test loops.


Please make sure that you added the line in both places, as shown in the code below:

```
# Looping over the batches in the train set
for x_batch, y_batch in train_loader:
    # Zeroing the gradients
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    # Forward pass
    y_pred = net(x_batch)
    # Reshaping the target tensor to match the input tensor
    y_batch = y_batch.view(-1, 1)
    # Computing the loss
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_batch)
    # Backward pass and optimization
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    # Updating the total loss and correct predictions
    train_loss += loss.item() * x_batch.size(0)
    train_correct += torch.sum((y_pred - y_batch).abs() &lt; 1e-3)

# Looping over the batches in the test set
for x_batch, y_batch in test_loader:
    # Forward pass
    y_pred = net(x_batch)
    # Reshaping the target tensor to match the input tensor
    y_batch = y_batch.view(-1, 1)
    # Computing the loss
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_batch)
    # Updating the total loss and correct predictions
    test_loss += loss.item() * x_batch.size(0)
    test_correct += torch.sum((y_pred - y_batch).abs() &lt; 1e-3)
```


This should fix the error and make the code run without any warnings. I hope this helps.😊



***

**Human:**

 I'm sorry! I had only added it to the first for loop. Before last fix, I also had another but similar error: /home/codespace/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/loss.py:536: UserWarning: Using a target size (torch.Size([11])) that is different to the input size (torch.Size([11, 1])). This will likely lead to incorrect results due to broadcasting. Please ensure they have the same size.
 Do you think it is fixed by the correction we made or is it something else?

***

**Assistant:**

No problem.😊


The other error message is also caused by the same issue of having different shapes for the input and target tensors. It is likely that the last batch in the test set has only 11 samples, which causes the mismatch in the sizes.


The correction we made should fix both errors, as it ensures that the target tensor always has a second dimension of size 1, regardless of the batch size.


You can try to run the code again and see if there are any more errors or warnings. I hope it works this time.😊



***

**Human:**

 What are for testing purposes reasonable changes to the search space to speed up the running of the code? I don't mind if it is not too accurate, I just would love to see results. To make sure we are still on the same page, do you remember the search space that you generated for me? The code is     # Sampling the hyperparameters from the search space
    n_layers = trial.suggest_int("n_layers", 1, 5)
    n_units = trial.suggest_int("n_units", 16, 256)
    hidden_activation_name = trial.suggest_categorical("hidden_activation", ["ReLU", "Tanh", "Sigmoid"])
    output_activation_name = trial.suggest_categorical("output_activation", ["ReLU", "Tanh", "Sigmoid"])
    loss_name = trial.suggest_categorical("loss", ["MSE", "MAE", "Huber"])
    optimizer_name = trial.suggest_categorical("optimizer", ["SGD", "Adam", "RMSprop"])
    lr = trial.suggest_loguniform("lr", 1e-5, 1e-1)
    batch_size = trial.suggest_int("batch_size", 32, 512)
    n_epochs = trial.suggest_int("n_epochs", 10, 100)
    scheduler_name = trial.suggest_categorical("scheduler", ["None", "StepLR", "ExponentialLR"])

***

**Assistant:**
Yes, I remember the search space that I generated for you.😊


To speed up the running of the code, you can try to reduce the search space by narrowing down the range of values for each hyperparameter or by fixing some hyperparameters to a constant value. This will reduce the number of possible combinations that Optuna has to explore and make the optimization faster.


For example, you can try the following changes to the search space:



- Reduce the range of n_layers from 1 to 5 to 1 to 3

- Reduce the range of n_units from 16 to 256 to 32 to 128

- Fix the hidden_activation_name and output_activation_name to “ReLU”

- Fix the loss_name to “MSE”

- Fix the scheduler_name to “None”




This will make the search space much smaller and simpler, and hopefully speed up the code. However, this may also affect the accuracy of the model, as you are limiting the choices of hyperparameters that Optuna can use. You may need to experiment with different values and trade-offs to find a good balance between speed and accuracy.


According to [<sup>1</sup>](https://datagy.io/python-optuna/), Optuna also has some features that can help you speed up the optimization process, such as:



- Pruning: This is a technique that stops unpromising trials early and saves computation time. Optuna supports various pruning algorithms that can be easily integrated with your code.

- Parallelization: This is a technique that runs multiple trials simultaneously on different processes or machines. Optuna supports various parallelization methods that can be easily configured with your code.

- Distributed optimization: This is a technique that distributes the optimization process across multiple nodes or clusters. Optuna supports various distributed optimization methods that can be easily set up with your code.




You can read more about these features and how to use them in [<sup>1</sup>](https://datagy.io/python-optuna/). I hope this helps.😊
