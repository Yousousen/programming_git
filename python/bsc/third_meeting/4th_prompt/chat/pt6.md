**Human:**

 In machine learning, is it ever reasonable to choose a batch size smaller than 32?

***

**Assistant:**

Batch size is a term used in machine learning and refers to the number of training examples utilised in one iteration</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/8560/how-do-i-choose-the-optimal-batch-size). It can have a significant impact on your model’s performance and the training time</a>[<sup>2</sup>](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/153531/what-is-batch-size-in-neural-network). In general, the optimal batch size will be lower than 32 (in April 2018, Yann Lecun even tweeted "Friends don’t let friends use mini-batches larger than 32“)</a>[<sup>2</sup>](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/153531/what-is-batch-size-in-neural-network). [However, a small batch size also has some disadvantages, such as less accurate estimate of the gradient and more noisy weight updates](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/52884/possible-for-batch-size-of-neural-network-to-be-too-small)[<sup>3</sup>](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/52884/possible-for-batch-size-of-neural-network-to-be-too-small). Therefore, choosing the optimal batch size depends on your task, data and computational resources.

**Human:**

 What is the smallest batch size that is reasonable to use?

***

**Assistant:**
There is no definitive answer to what is the smallest batch size that is reasonable to use, as it depends on various factors such as your data, model, task and computational resources. However, some general guidelines are:



- [If you have a small training set (m &lt; 200), you can use batch gradient descent (batch size = m) ](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/8560/how-do-i-choose-the-optimal-batch-size)[<sup>1</sup>](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/8560/how-do-i-choose-the-optimal-batch-size).

- If you have a large training set, you can use mini-batch gradient descent (batch size &lt; m) [<sup>1</sup>](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/8560/how-do-i-choose-the-optimal-batch-size). [The typically mini-batch sizes are 64, 128, 256 or 512 ](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/8560/how-do-i-choose-the-optimal-batch-size)[<sup>1</sup>](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/8560/how-do-i-choose-the-optimal-batch-size). [However, smaller batch sizes (such as 2 or 32) have been shown to provide improved generalization performance and smaller memory footprint ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07612)[<sup>2</sup>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07612).

- [You should make sure the mini-batch fits in the CPU/GPU memory ](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/8560/how-do-i-choose-the-optimal-batch-size)[<sup>1</sup>](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/8560/how-do-i-choose-the-optimal-batch-size). [You can also tune the batch size to an aspect of the computational architecture, such as a power of two ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07612)[<sup>2</sup>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07612).

- [You should avoid using stochastic gradient descent (batch size = 1), as it loses speed up from vectorization and has more noisy weight updates ](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/8560/how-do-i-choose-the-optimal-batch-size)[<sup>1</sup>](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/8560/how-do-i-choose-the-optimal-batch-size).

**Human:**

 Can I use stochastic gradient descent with a batch size other than 1?

***

**Assistant:**

No, stochastic gradient descent is defined as having a batch size of 1. If you use a batch size greater than 1, you are using mini-batch gradient descent. The term stochastic refers to the fact that each sample is randomly selected from the training set.

**Human:**

 Does it ever make sense to have just one unit in a hidden layer?

***

**Assistant:**

[A hidden layer in a neural network is a layer that is located between the input and output layers, and performs nonlinear transformations of the inputs entered into the network](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/hidden-layer-machine-learning)[<sup>1</sup>](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/hidden-layer-machine-learning). [The hidden layer’s job is to transform the inputs into something that the output layer can use](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/63152/what-does-the-hidden-layer-in-a-neural-network-compute)[<sup>2</sup>](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/63152/what-does-the-hidden-layer-in-a-neural-network-compute). [The number of units in a hidden layer determines how many features or patterns the layer can learn from the data](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44747343/keras-input-explanation-input-shape-units-batch-size-dim-etc)[<sup>3</sup>](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44747343/keras-input-explanation-input-shape-units-batch-size-dim-etc). Having just one unit in a hidden layer means that the layer can only learn one feature or pattern, which may not be enough to capture the complexity of the data. Therefore, it may not make sense to have just one unit in a hidden layer, unless the data is very simple or linearly separable. However, this also depends on the number of hidden layers and the activation functions used in the network. [In some cases, having one unit in a hidden layer may be useful for dimensionality reduction or bottleneck features](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44747343/keras-input-explanation-input-shape-units-batch-size-dim-etc)[<sup>3</sup>](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44747343/keras-input-explanation-input-shape-units-batch-size-dim-etc).



***

**Human:**

 What I mean is, if I am defining a seach space to optimize the hyperparameters, should I include in that search space the possibility to have one hidden unit in a layer?

***

**Assistant:**

That depends on your goal and the type of data you are working with. If you are trying to optimize the performance of your neural network on a complex or nonlinear task, then having one hidden unit in a layer may not be very helpful, as it may limit the expressive power of your network. However, if you are trying to optimize the efficiency or simplicity of your network, or if your data is very simple or linearly separable, then having one hidden unit in a layer may be a valid option to consider. Ultimately, the best way to find out is to experiment with different configurations and compare the results.
