> Please help me conceptually understanding what I want to do, what I'm doing, and if I am doing it correctly. I have the following sampling intervals \`\`\`python rho\_interval = (0, 2) # sample in linear space epsilon\_interval = (1e-9, 1500) # sample in log space vx\_interval = (0, 0.999) # sample in linear space vy\_interval = (0, 0.999) # sample in linear space vz\_interval = (0, 0.999) # sample in linear space Bx\_interval = (-10, 10) # sample in linear space By\_interval = (-10, 10) # sample in linear space Bz\_interval = (-10, 10) # sample in linear space gxx\_interval = (0.9, 1.1) gxy\_interval = (0, 0.1) gxz\_interval = (0, 0.1) gyy\_interval = (0.9, 1.1) gyz\_interval = (0, 0.1) gzz\_interval = (0.9, 1.1) \`\`\` These should all be sampled in linear space, except for epsilon, which should be sampled in log space. This I'm currently trying to achieve with the following lines \`\`\`python rho = np.random.uniform(\*rho\_interval) # epsilon = np.logspace(\*np.log10(epsilon\_interval)) epsilon = np.random.choice(np.logspace(\*np.log10(epsilon\_interval))) vx = np.random.uniform(\*vx\_interval) vy = np.random.uniform(\*vy\_interval) vz = np.random.uniform(\*vz\_interval) Bx = np.random.uniform(\*Bx\_interval) By = np.random.uniform(\*By\_interval) Bz = np.random.uniform(\*Bz\_interval) gxx = np.random.uniform(\*gxx\_interval) gxy = np.random.uniform(\*gxy\_interval) gxz = np.random.uniform(\*gxz\_interval) gyy = np.random.uniform(\*gyy\_interval) gyz = np.random.uniform(\*gyz\_interval) gzz = np.random.uniform(\*gzz\_interval) \`\`\` My issues are the following 1. Must I use first \`np.logspace\` if I am to sample epsilon in log space? 2. Must I use random choice? Is there not an equivalent of \`np.random.uniform\` for log space?

In your code, you are generating random samples for a number of parameters, such as `rho`, `epsilon`, `vx`, `vy`, etc. Most of these parameters are sampled in linear space using the `np.random.uniform` function, which generates a random float from a uniform distribution within the specified interval.

For `epsilon`, you want to sample it in log space, which means the logarithm of `epsilon` should be uniformly distributed.

To your specific questions:

1.  Yes, you can use `np.logspace` to generate samples that are evenly spaced on a log scale between two end points. It's important to note that `np.logspace` generates samples that are evenly spaced on a log scale, not randomly sampled. However, the way you're currently using `np.logspace` and `np.random.choice` in combination is not the best approach because it first generates a sequence of evenly spaced numbers on a log scale, and then selects one of them randomly, which isn't exactly a "random sample in log space".
    
2.  There's no direct equivalent of `np.random.uniform` for log space in numpy, but you can achieve the desired result by applying `np.random.uniform` to the log of the endpoints of your interval, and then exponentiating the result. This works because if `X` is uniformly distributed, then `b^X` has a log-uniform distribution. Here's how you can do this:
    

python

```python
log_epsilon_interval = np.log10(epsilon_interval)
epsilon = 10 ** np.random.uniform(*log_epsilon_interval)
```

This will generate a random sample from a log-uniform distribution over the specified `epsilon_interval`. This should give you the desired behavior of `epsilon` being sampled in log space.

> Can you elaborate on 2? To me, it seems like we are not sampling in log space because we first take the log of the epsilon interval, take a uniform number from it, and then expoentiate again, the first and the last being inverse operations. Furthermore, what exactly does it mean to take random uniform of the logarithmic interval?

Yes, of course, I'm happy to elaborate!

When we say we're sampling in "log space," what we mean is that the logarithm of the variable is uniformly distributed. So, instead of the variable itself having a uniform distribution, its logarithm does.

Let's consider your `epsilon_interval` which is `(1e-9, 1500)`. If we were to sample uniformly from this interval, we would be just as likely to draw a number between `1e-9` and `1` as we would be to draw a number between `1` and `1500`. However, the latter interval is much larger and covers a much greater range of magnitudes.

When we sample in "log space," we instead make it equally likely to draw a number from any interval of the same multiplicative size. So for example, it's just as likely to draw a number between `1e-9` and `1e-8` (which is a 10-fold increase) as it is to draw a number between `100` and `1000` (also a 10-fold increase).

To achieve this, we take the logarithm of the interval endpoints, which transforms our original interval into the interval `(log(1e-9), log(1500))` or about `(-20, 3.18)`. Now, when we draw a number uniformly from this transformed interval, we're equally likely to draw a number from any interval of the same additive size (because the logarithm turns multiplication into addition).

Finally, we take the antilog (or equivalently, exponentiate base 10) of our drawn number to transform it back into the original space of the variable. The result is a number that's uniformly distributed on a logarithmic scale, or "in log space."

So, the operations of taking the log and then exponentiating aren't just cancelling each other out. The key is that the uniform random sampling is happening in between those two steps, when the variable is in the logarithmic space. This effectively changes the distribution of the variable when it's transformed back into its original space.

To put it another way, the operations of taking the log and then exponentiating are changing the "shape" of the uniform distribution so that it's uniform on a logarithmic scale instead of a linear scale.

As for your last question, taking a "random uniform of the logarithmic interval" just means drawing a number uniformly from the interval of the logarithms of the original interval endpoints. The result is a number whose logarithm is uniformly distributed.
