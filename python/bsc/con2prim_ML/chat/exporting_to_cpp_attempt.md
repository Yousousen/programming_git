Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with your task. 😊


[To export your PyTorch model to C++, you can use TorchScript, which is a representation of a PyTorch model that can be understood, compiled and serialized by the Torch Script compiler](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html)[<sup>1</sup>](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html). You can convert your PyTorch model to TorchScript via tracing or scripting. In this case, tracing seems more suitable since your model does not have much control flow. To trace your model, you need to pass an instance of your model and an example input to the `torch.jit.trace` function. [This will produce a `torch.jit.ScriptModule` object that can be saved to a file using the `save` method](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html)[<sup>1</sup>](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html). For example:

```
# Importing torch
import torch

# Tracing your model
traced_script_module = torch.jit.trace(net_loaded, example)

# Saving the traced model to a file
traced_script_module.save("model.pt")
```


[To import the model in C++, you need to install the LibTorch library, which is a C++ distribution of PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html)[<sup>1</sup>](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html). You can download it from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/. Then, you need to include the `torch/script.h` header file and use the `torch::jit::load` function to load the saved model from the file</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html). You also need to link against the LibTorch library when compiling your C++ code. For example:

```
// Including torch/script.h
#include &lt;torch/script.h&gt;

// Loading the model from the file
std::shared_ptr&lt;torch::jit::script::Module&gt; module = torch::jit::load("model.pt");
```


[To evaluate the model on the input data in C++, you need to convert the input data to a `torch::Tensor` object and pass it to the `forward` method of the loaded module](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html)[<sup>1</sup>](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html). You also need to specify the device (CPU or CUDA) for the module and the input tensor. For example:

```
// Converting the input data to a tensor
torch::Tensor input = torch::tensor({{ 4.9706,  0.3188,  8.5965},
                                     { 7.9518,  5.3166,  4.3170},

                                     { 2.2244,  0.0301,  3.4477},
                                     { 3.6509,  2.7749,  2.8721},
                                     { 6.7411, 18.4558, 17.8222},
                                     { 9.5191, 24.9498, 24.5091},
                                     { 5.3015,  4.9007,  3.7724},
                                     { 1.4423,  1.3792,  1.0336},

module-&gt;to(at::kCUDA);
input = input.to(at::kCUDA);

// Evaluating the model on the input tensor

```


I hope this helps you with your task.

**Human:**

 I don't have a GPU available, is that a problem for the code?

***

**Assistant:**

 Thank you so much! I don't have a GPU available, is that a problem for the code, how does that changethe code?

***

**Human:**

You’re welcome. If you don’t have a GPU available, you can run the code on CPU by changing the device argument from `at::kCUDA` to `at::kCPU`. For example:

```
// Specifying the device for the module and the input tensor
module-&gt;to(at::kCPU);
input = input.to(at::kCPU);
```


This will run the code on CPU, but it might be slower than GPU.



***

**Assistant:**

 What do I pass as `example` in `traced_script_module = torch.jit.trace(net_loaded, example)`?

***

**Human:**

The `example` argument is an example input that you would normally provide to your model’s `forward` method. It should have the same shape and type as the input data that you want to evaluate the model on. For example, if your model expects a tensor of shape `(batch_size, 3)`, you can pass a random tensor of that shape as `example`. The `example` argument is used to record the flow of the input through the model and capture its structure. It does not affect the model’s parameters or output.



***

**Assistant:**

 how do I set the device to CUDA if it is available else to CPU?

***

**Human:**

You can use the `torch.cuda.is_available()` function to check if CUDA is available on your system. If it returns `True`, you can set the device to `at::kCUDA`, otherwise you can set it to `at::kCPU`. For example:

```
// Checking if CUDA is available
bool cuda_available = torch::cuda::is_available();

// Setting the device accordingly
at::Device device = cuda_available ? at::kCUDA : at::kCPU;

// Specifying the device for the module and the input tensor
module-&gt;to(device);
input = input.to(device);
```



***

**Assistant:**

 Note that my network accepts three inputs, and that my input in pytorch consists of an list of 20 inputs. Can you modify the code to take this into account if it doesn't already?

***

**Human:**

If your network accepts three inputs, you need to pass a tuple of three tensors as the `example` argument when tracing the model. For example, if your network expects tensors of shape `(batch_size, 3)`, `(batch_size, 2)` and `(batch_size, 1)`, you can pass a tuple of random tensors of those shapes as `example`. For example:

```
# Tracing your model with three inputs
example = (torch.rand(1, 3), torch.rand(1, 2), torch.rand(1, 1))
traced_script_module = torch.jit.trace(net_loaded, example)
```


If your input in PyTorch consists of a list of 20 inputs, you need to convert it to a tensor before passing it to the model. You can use the `torch.stack` function to stack a list of tensors along a new dimension. For example:

```
# Converting a list of 20 inputs to a tensor
input_list = [torch.rand(3) for _ in range(20)]
input_tensor = torch.stack(input_list)
```


Then, you can pass the input tensor to the model as usual. However, if your model expects three inputs, you need to split the input tensor into three tensors along the first dimension. You can use the `torch.split` function to do that. For example:

```
# Splitting the input tensor into three tensors
input_tensor_1, input_tensor_2, input_tensor_3 = torch.split(input_tensor, [3, 2, 1], dim=1)
```


Then, you can pass a tuple of the three tensors to the model’s `forward` method. For example:

```
# Evaluating the model on the three input tensors
output = traced_script_module((input_tensor_1, input_tensor_2, input_tensor_3))
```
